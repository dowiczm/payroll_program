# Summary

Pull all files from the 'software' folder, and save them in a folder on your desktop. The version3.py file can then be run from the command line to open the GUI-application. 

Alternatively, use pyinstaller to bundle the version3.py file into a single package. This method was used for CT Spa Group.
